# Flow - A CiviCRM UI written in pure Angular

This repo contains the foundation for a Angular Material UI for CiviCRM. It should be populated with Boilerplate codegenerated by [Ebb](https://github.com/michaelmcandrew/ebb).

## Getting started

1. Generate source files for your CiviCRM installation with Ebb.
2. Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.
