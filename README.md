# Flow - A CiviCRM UI written in pure Angular

This repo is mostly generated code. In an ideal world, it is generated in its entirety by Ebb.

## Getting started

1. Generate source files for your CiviCRM installation with Ebb.
2. Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.
